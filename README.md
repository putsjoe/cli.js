# cli.js
## A Javascript CLI framework

Bringing the command line to the web, control your data with a powerful command line.

## TODO
* Find a way of formatting the cli div with css in the js.
* Create CLI as a class, be alot easier and most likely how a 'framework' should work.
* Simple way of creating commands for the bar.
* Aim to not have to use cli.js to add commands (Linked to classes suppose).

## FUTURE
* Able to switch views and copy to second panel.
* Tab completion.
