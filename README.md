# cli.js
## A CLI JavaScript Framework

Bringing the command line to the web, control your data with a powerful command line.

Needs adding at the end of the page for loading.

## TODO
* Find a way of formatting the cli div with css in the js but better than doing it now.
* Create CLI as a class, be alot easier and most likely how a 'framework' should work.
* Simple way of creating commands for the bar.
* Aim to not have to use cli.js to add commands (Linked to classes suppose).
* Find a way of loading the CSS parts at start of page load, so that it doesnt flash up. (there may be a document.preload or something).

## FUTURE
* Able to switch views and copy to second panel.
* Tab completion.
* Up and Down keys for cycling through history.
